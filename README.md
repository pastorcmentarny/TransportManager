# **README**

# **WARM WELCOME** fellow citizen

I guess must be lost as there is no other reason to be on this project page. I am impressed that in the world of the
GitHub where there are many amazing projects, you are looking for the project that is anti-pattern of programming :).

# **HONEST WARNING**:

* Code quality is shocking and depressing because the purpose of this project is not to write code that is "production
  awesome".
* It is a learning project, so you may see many coding styles used through this project because I like to
  experiment with different libraries, code styles and see what is most suitable for me.
* You may read advice on the
  internet. Read other people code and learn from it but don't use this project for that :).

# **ABOUT THIS PROJECT**

I create a project to allow me to learn Spring Framework and various things that are Spring related.
This project will allow me to track progress in seeing all station in the UK (Tube,Overground and Trains)
This is a service that is response for manage specific data to type of transport but at the moment it manages all data :D

Note: In normal world, you will have each database for each service but for simplicity I have one db, written by myself ...in Python ;P
